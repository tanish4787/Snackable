Snackable – MVP
===============

**Snackable** is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) designed to showcase backend development capabilities. While the user interface is intentionally kept simple to focus on backend functionality, the core system demonstrates efficient data handling, robust API design, and scalable architecture.

🚀 Overview
-----------

Snackable is a backend-centric application developed to highlight:

*   **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with clear routing and error handling.
    
*   **Database Architecture**: Optimized schema design for scalability.
    
*   **Authentication**: Secure token-based user authentication.
    
*   **Error Handling**: Centralized error management for consistent responses.
    

🛠️ Technologies Used
---------------------

*   **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
    
*   **Database**: MongoDB
    
*   **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
    
*   **Environment Management**: dotenv
    
*   **Testing**: Jest
    

⚙️ Features
-----------

*   **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with JWT.
    
*   **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for core resources.
    
*   **Error Handling**: Consistent and informative error responses.
